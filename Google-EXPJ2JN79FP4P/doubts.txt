K window of a list = distinct elements in the first K elements
Given 2 lists, modify list2 such that the k windows of the 2 lists don't have any common element. Return the new list (Asked to optimize the space multiple times).


Variation:
Instead of 2 lists we have n lists, and a distance parameter d, the k window of a list shouldn't have any common element with any of the previous 'd' lists. Return the new lists
